This hack allows players to see the positions of their enemies on the game's minimap, even if they are not visible on the screen. This can be an incredibly useful tool in situations where players need to quickly locate enemies or avoid being flanked. However, it is important to note that the use of radar hacks is strictly prohibited in STANDOFF 2, and players who are caught using them can be permanently banned from the game."
